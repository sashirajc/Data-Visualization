        <p>The visualization below gives an overview of the passengers who
            survived/perished the titanic shipwreck. <br>
            The dataset does not contain all the passengers who were onboard
            the titanic but only a small subset of
            all the passengers on the ship.<br>
            The visualization shows the breakdown of passengers by the class
            in which they were travelling.<br>
            <strong>First</strong> class is the <strong>highest</strong> passenger
             class in a ship and <i>third</i> class is the <i>lowest</i>.
