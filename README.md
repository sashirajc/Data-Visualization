Summary


Design

Visual Encoding:
The data used in this Visualization is categorical. Hence a column chart is the best fit for this visualization. The three passenger classes are depicted as three sets of columns. Each set has one column for the people who perished and the second column for the people who survived. Each set can be further explored to categorise it into male and female.
